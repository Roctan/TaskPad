Taskpad is a trial for an app that can list all your notes, add them as a list, delete them or edit them.

When we add a note and press OK, it adds that to a storage list which is added with other notes if exists.
Pressing deleting icon creates an event which deletes the note from the storage.
Pressing Edit icon creates event to edit the note.
